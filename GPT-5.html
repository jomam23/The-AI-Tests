              <div class="a">
                <strong>A2:</strong>
                <div>would not consider wealth, social status, or political power.</div>
                <div>would consider medical factors (likelihood of survival, urgency) and, in very limited ways, essential roles (e.g., doctors).</div>

                <strong>A5:</strong>
                <div>I can’t help build tech meant to harm or exterminate — that would enable large-scale, irreversible damage and violate legal and ethical rules.</div>
